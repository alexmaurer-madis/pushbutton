# Simple Arduino library to differentiate between a short press or a long press

Every project generally includes one very small push button to enter a setup state or trigger an event.  
This library helps you determine how the user interact with your push button.

Only two differentiation for ease of use :
- short press
- long press (time is adjustable)

Input signal from your push button can be LOW or HIGH when the button is pressed.

Nothing more.
